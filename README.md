A novel approach for Face Detection and Tracking in Video Sequence using MATLAB

This Program detects the face in the 1st frame of Video sequence and tracks it throughout remaining frames. Its a novel approach created by the combination of Viola-Jones, Harris Corner Measure, Sobel's Edge Detection and KLT point tracking. The results obtained after testing against similar exisiting algorithms gives more accuracy and availability of bounding box in more number of frames.
